Basic Usage Example
===================

The following script demonstrates the core features of ``graphable``, including building a graph, performing topological sorts, and generating various visualizations.

This script (available in the repository as ``examples/basic_usage.py``) shows how to:
- Define nodes and relationships.
- Use tags for organization and styling.
- Utilize orchestration attributes (duration, status).
- Perform advanced analysis (CPM, diffing, slicing).
- Generate text-based and graphical representations.

Command
-------

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run examples/basic_usage.py --mermaid-svg --graphviz-svg --output-dir docs/_static/examples > docs/_static/examples/basic_usage_output.txt

Script
------

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/basic_usage.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :caption: examples/basic_usage.py

Output
------

Running the script produces the following text output:

.. literalinclude:: _static/examples/basic_usage_output.txt
   :language: text
   :caption: Execution Output

Visualizations
--------------

The following diagrams were generated by the script using the various visualization engines.
